[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most popular open source Content Management System (CMS), powering nearly one-third of all websites in the world. It can be used for multiple purposes, such as hosting blogs, forums, e-commerce, project management, document management, and much more. 

A CMS is made up of two key components:

- A Content Management Application (CMA) - the interface used to add and manage content.
- A Content Delivery Application (CDA) - the backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working, visually appealing website.
